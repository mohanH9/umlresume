        <h3>Multi Object Detection and Ranging System for Autonomous Vehicles
            Using Enhanced RGB Color Model</h3>
            <p>Description: Autonomous vehicles represent a transformative technological advancement with the potential
                to revolutionize transportation and improve road safety. Central to the functionality of these vehicles is their
                ability to perceive and interpret the surrounding environment accurately. The traditional RGB color model
                has been enhanced to improve object recognition and scene understanding under various lighting conditions
                and weather scenarios. By leveraging the YOLO algorithm, our system achieves real-time object detection
                and ranging, making it highly suitable for the dynamic and fast-paced nature of autonomous driving<br>
                Tools Used: Python , Machine Learning
